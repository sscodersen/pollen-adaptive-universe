# Overview

This is a React-based AI-powered content platform called "Pollen Adaptive Universe" built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The platform provides an all-in-one ecosystem for AI-generated content across multiple domains including music, entertainment, games, shopping, and task automation. The system features a sophisticated AI backend (Pollen LLMX) designed to run in Docker containers and integrates with external Python services for advanced AI capabilities.
