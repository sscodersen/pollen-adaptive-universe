# Recent Changes (October 2025)

## Community Engagement & Feedback Loop Features (October 11, 2025)

### Implemented Backend Infrastructure
- **Database Schema** (20+ new tables):
  - Chat system: `chat_rooms`, `chat_messages`, `chat_participants`
  - Gamification: `badges`, `user_badges`, `point_transactions`, `user_points`, `leaderboards`
  - Events: `events`, `event_registrations`, `event_speakers`
  - Feedback: `feedback_submissions`, `feedback_responses`, `feedback_categories`, `feedback_analytics`
  - Curated Content: `curated_content`, `curated_content_sections`
  - Notifications: `notifications`

- **REST API Endpoints** (in local-backend.cjs):
  - `/api/community/chat/rooms` - Chat room management
  - `/api/community/gamification/*` - Badges, points, leaderboards
  - `/api/community/events` - Virtual events and webinars
  - `/api/community/feedback` - NLP-powered feedback collection and analysis

### TypeScript Server Modules (Pending Integration)
Located in `server/` directory:
- `server/storage.ts` - Database-backed storage classes for all features
- `server/routes/community.ts` - TypeScript API routes
- `server/chatServer.ts` - WebSocket chat server implementation
- `server/services/feedbackAnalyzer.ts` - Advanced NLP feedback analyzer

### Integration Status & Next Steps

**Current State:**
- ✅ Database tables created and available
- ✅ Database connection configured (`server/db.ts`)
- ✅ TypeScript storage classes implemented
- ✅ REST APIs functional in local-backend.cjs (in-memory)
- ✅ WebSocket server operational
- ⚠️ **Integration Gap**: TypeScript modules not yet wired to production backend
- ⚠️ **Data Persistence**: Current implementation uses in-memory storage; needs migration to database-backed storage
- ⚠️ **Authentication**: WebSocket server needs authentication/authorization layer

**Production Readiness Tasks:**
1. Wire TypeScript storage classes to local-backend.cjs or migrate to TypeScript-first backend
2. Replace in-memory storage with database-backed storage using existing Drizzle ORM
3. Add authentication middleware to WebSocket server
4. Implement rate limiting for chat and API endpoints
5. Create frontend UI components for:
   - Chat interface
   - Gamification dashboard
   - Events calendar
   - Feedback submission forms
   - Curated content sections
6. Add proper error handling and logging
7. Create API documentation

**Architecture Options:**
1. **Hybrid Approach**: Keep local-backend.cjs, import compiled TypeScript storage modules
2. **Full TypeScript Migration**: Replace local-backend.cjs with TypeScript server
3. **Microservices**: Separate community features into dedicated service
