# New Frontier AI Platform - Powered by Pollen AI

## Overview
A privacy-first, production-ready social media platform leveraging AI-generated content. It features a modern three-column layout with real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) and AI-powered content generation across various domains. The platform is built with a React + Vite frontend and a FastAPI backend, designed with a professional dark theme. Its core principle is 100% anonymity, with all data stored locally, zero tracking, and full user control over their data.

## User Preferences
- **Modern Dark Theme** - AI Sight-inspired design with purple/gray gradients
- **Privacy-First** - 100% anonymous, no sign-in, local storage only
- **SSE Streaming** - Real-time AI responses across all features
- **Professional UI** - Glassmorphism, smooth animations, gradient accents
- **Custom AI Model** - Support for Pollen AI model via environment variable
- **Production-Ready** - Deployment guides for Vercel (frontend) and Railway/Render (backend)
- **Comprehensive Features** - Explore page, Profile page, Response actions, History tracking

## System Architecture

### Frontend (React + Vite)
The frontend utilizes React 18 with Vite 4, Chakra UI for a professional dark theme, and React Router DOM v7 for routing. It implements a three-column social media layout (280px left, flexible center, 340px right) with flat black cards, purple hover effects, and glassmorphism accents. Key features include a unified search bar, responsive design, and privacy-focused local storage for user data.

### Backend (FastAPI)
The backend is built with FastAPI (Python 3.11) and uses `sse-starlette` for Server-Sent Events. It integrates with a custom Pollen AI model (with OpenAI fallback) for AI-powered content generation, including posts, trending topics, events, and user suggestions. A BeautifulSoup4 web scraper acts as a fallback system. All API endpoints are SSE-enabled.

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a dark theme with gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism effects, and a mobile-first responsive design. It includes a floating global search (Cmd/Ctrl+K), personalized dashboards, and professional loading/error states.
