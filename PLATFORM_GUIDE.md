# Pollen AI Platform - Complete Guide

## üéØ What This Platform Is Now

You now have a **fully functional AI-powered content curation platform** that:

1. **Automatically scrapes** content from multiple sources daily (Hacker News, TechCrunch, BBC News, Exploding Topics, etc.)
2. **Scores every piece** using the Bento Buzz 7-factor algorithm
3. **Stores only high-quality content** in a PostgreSQL database
4. **Serves curated content** through API endpoints
5. **Trains Pollen AI** with the best content automatically

## üß† Bento Buzz Scoring System

Every piece of content is scored on **7 critical factors** (0-100 each):

### 1. **Scope** (15% weight)
- How many people are affected by this content?
- Global news scores higher than local news
- Keywords: "global", "worldwide", "millions", "industry"

### 2. **Intensity** (15% weight)
- How impactful is this event/topic?
- Revolutionary breakthroughs score higher
- Keywords: "breakthrough", "crisis", "massive", "unprecedented"

### 3. **Originality** (15% weight)
- Is this novel or just another repeat story?
- New discoveries and innovations score higher
- Keywords: "first", "discovery", "innovative", "pioneering"

### 4. **Immediacy** (10% weight)
- How recent is this content?
- Content <1 hour old scores 100
- Content 1+ weeks old scores 10-30

### 5. **Practicability** (15% weight)
- Can readers take action based on this?
- How-to guides and actionable advice score higher
- Keywords: "how to", "tips", "steps", "save", "improve"

### 6. **Positivity** (10% weight)
- Counters media negativity bias
- Balanced or positive stories score higher
- Keywords: "progress", "solution", "innovation" vs "crisis", "disaster"

### 7. **Credibility** (20% weight - highest weight)
- How reliable is the source?
- BBC (90), Reuters (95), Nature (95), TechCrunch (75)
- Academic sources get bonus points

**Overall Score** = Weighted average of all 7 factors

**Quality Threshold** = Currently set to 50/100 (can be adjusted)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Architecture

### Tables Created

1. **content** - All scraped content
   - content_id, title, description, url, source, image_url
   - content_type (news, trend, event, product)
   - raw_data (full JSON), created_at, published_at

2. **content_scores** - Bento Buzz scores for each content item
   - All 7 individual scores + overall_score
   - trending flag (for scores >= 85)

3. **training_data** - High-quality content for Pollen AI training
   - quality_score, engagement_metrics
   - used_for_training flag, training_batch_id

4. **user_preferences** - User personalization
   - interests, categories, algorithm_preference
   - min_quality_score, engagement_history

5. **scraper_jobs** - Job tracking and monitoring
   - job_id, status, items_scraped/scored/passed
   - error tracking, timestamps

## üîÑ How The System Works

### Daily Automated Flow

```
1. Background Scraper runs (every 24 hours)
   ‚Üì
2. Scrapes content from:
   - Hacker News (tech news + points)
   - TechCrunch RSS feed
   - BBC News RSS feed
   - Exploding Topics (trending topics)
   - Mock events/products (replace with real sources)
   ‚Üì
3. Each item gets scored using Bento Buzz algorithm
   ‚Üì
4. Only items scoring >= 50/100 are stored
   ‚Üì
5. Items scoring >= 80/100 added to training dataset
   ‚Üì
6. Pollen AI training triggered when enough data available
   ‚Üì
7. Content served through API endpoints
```

### Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger scraping:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/feed-v2/trigger-scrape
```

## üì° API Endpoints

### New Database-Powered Endpoints (v2)

#### Get Feed Posts
```
GET /api/feed-v2/posts?min_score=50&limit=50&content_type=news
```
Returns: Scored content from database

#### Get Trending Topics
```
GET /api/feed-v2/trending?limit=10
```
Returns: Trending topics with growth metrics

#### Get Events
```
GET /api/feed-v2/events?limit=10
```
Returns: Upcoming events

#### Get Statistics
```
GET /api/feed-v2/stats
```
Returns:
```json
{
  "total_content": 59,
  "high_quality_content": 59,
  "excellent_quality_content": 0,
  "training_data_available": 0,
  "quality_percentage": 100
}
```

#### Scraper Job Status
```
GET /api/feed-v2/scrape-status
```
Returns: Recent scraping jobs and their status

## üöÄ How To Use

### 1. Initialize the Platform (One-time)

```bash
# Run initialization script
uv run python -m backend.initialize
```

This will:
- Create database tables
- Run initial content scraping
- Populate database with ~50-80 high-quality items

### 2. Start the Server

The backend should already be running via the workflow. If not:

```bash
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 3. Test the Endpoints

```bash
# Get platform info
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Get scored content
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/feed-v2/posts?limit=5"

# Get statistics
curl http://localhost:8000/api/feed-v2/stats

# Trigger manual scrape
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/feed-v2/trigger-scrape
```

### 4. Frontend Integration

Update your frontend to use the new endpoints:

```javascript
// In src/features/feed/Feed.jsx
const fetchPosts = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/feed-v2/posts?min_score=50&limit=50');
  const data = await response.json();
  setPosts(data);
};
```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Adjust Quality Threshold

In `backend/services/content_storage.py`:

```python
class ContentStorageService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.min_quality_threshold = 50.0  # Adjust this (0-100)
```

- **70+** = Very strict, only excellent content
- **50-70** = Balanced, high-quality content
- **<50** = Lenient, more content but lower quality

### Add New Content Sources

In `backend/services/enhanced_scraper.py`, add to RSS feeds:

```python
feeds = [
    {"url": "https://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index", "source": "Ars Technica", "category": "technology"},
    # Add more RSS feeds here
]
```

### Customize Scoring Weights

In `backend/services/adaptive_scorer.py`:

```python
self.weights = {
    "scope": 0.15,        # Adjust these
    "intensity": 0.15,    # Total must = 1.0
    "originality": 0.15,
    "immediacy": 0.10,
    "practicability": 0.15,
    "positivity": 0.10,
    "credibility": 0.20
}
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Scraper Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/feed-v2/scrape-status
```

### View Database Directly

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql $DATABASE_URL

# View content
SELECT title, source, overall_score FROM content_scores 
JOIN content ON content_scores.content_id = content.content_id 
ORDER BY overall_score DESC LIMIT 10;

# View statistics
SELECT 
  content_type, 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  AVG(overall_score) as avg_score
FROM content_scores 
JOIN content ON content_scores.content_id = content.content_id
GROUP BY content_type;
```
