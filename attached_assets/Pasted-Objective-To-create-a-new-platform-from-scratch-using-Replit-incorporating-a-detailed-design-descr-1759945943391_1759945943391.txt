Objective: To create a new platform from scratch using Replit, incorporating a detailed design description, setting up the technology stack, and implementing foundational features.

Instructions:

Project Initialization:
"Initialize a new project in Replit using the 'Next.js' template. Ensure the project is set up with the latest version of Next.js and React."
Design Implementation:
"Use the following detailed design description to implement the design in Replit. Create a responsive and intuitive user interface that matches the described design. Ensure that the design is adaptable to both web and mobile platforms."
General Design Elements:
"Implement a color scheme with soft pastel shades of pink, blue, and green as primary colors. Use a light gradient background with subtle dots and white and light gray for text and icons."
"Use a modern, clean sans-serif font for headings and a legible, slightly lighter sans-serif font for body text."
"Incorporate minimalistic and flat design icons, placing them within cards or next to text for better visual hierarchy."
Specific Screens:
Welcome Screen:
"Create a header with a rounded avatar image of the user on the top left."
"Add a greeting message 'Hey Jane, Welcome back!' in a friendly font."
"Include a small weather widget showing temperature and weather condition."
"Design three main cards below the greeting: a Travel card with an image of a famous landmark and a '+2' badge, a Sister's Birthday Party card with options like Gift, Music, Restaurant, and an Event Reminder card with a countdown timer '12 min'."
Search Results Screen:
"Place a search bar at the top with the query 'What's interesting going on in SF?'."
"Create a large result card with the title 'What to try in San Francisco?' and a brief description."
"Include three images of the Golden Gate Bridge."
"Add navigation options with buttons for Driving, Biking, Walking."
"Display location info showing the current location and distance to the Golden Gate Bridge."
Collections Screen:
"Create a header 'My Collections' with tabs for All collections, Personal, Suggested."
"Design collection cards: a Travel card with 4 items and thumbnail images, a Food card with 6 items and thumbnail images, a Goals card with progress rings showing percentages, an Events card with upcoming events and dates, and a Shopping card with 16 items and thumbnail images."
Shopping Screen:
"Create a header 'Shopping' with tabs for All, Info, Images, Products."
"Design product cards: a Wireless Headphones card with an image, description, price, and delivery option, a Power Bank card with an image, price, and rating, an Electric Vehicle card with an image and description, and additional products with thumbnail images."
Interactive Elements:
"Style buttons and links with rounded corners, soft colors, and hover effects. Place them strategically for easy access and navigation."
"Create a prominent and easy-to-access search bar. Include options for filters and sorting to refine search results."
"Design subtle, non-intrusive pop-ups or banners for notifications and alerts. Place them at the bottom or top of the screen."
Responsive Design:
Mobile Version:
"Create a vertical scroll layout with clear sections."
"Implement a bottom navigation bar or hamburger menu for navigation."
"Stack cards vertically with ample spacing."
Web Version:
"Use a grid or column-based layout."
"Implement a top navigation bar or sidebar for navigation."
"Place cards side-by-side with responsive sizing."
Additional Features:
"Allow users to customize their avatar in the user profile."
"Provide access to account settings and preferences in the user profile."
"Implement real-time updates and reminders for notifications. Allow users to customize what notifications they receive."
"Integrate advanced search functionality with filters and sorting options. Add voice search integration for voice-activated searches."
Anonymous User System:
"Develop a system for generating unique, anonymous identifiers for each user. Implement local storage to save user preferences and settings. Ensure that user data is handled securely and anonymously."
Technology Stack Setup:
"Install and configure the following dependencies in Replit: React, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, and any other necessary libraries or frameworks."
"Set up version control with Git within Replit. Ensure that the repository is well-organized and that all changes are committed and pushed regularly."
Basic Features:
"Implement a search component with semantic search capabilities using the Pollen AI model. Ensure that the search function is integrated seamlessly into the user interface."
"Develop a dynamic feed and explore page, powered by Pollen's trend analysis. Ensure that these pages are responsive and provide a engaging user experience."
"Create content curation and creative assistance tools modules. These tools should help users generate and curate content effectively."
Testing and Deployment:
"Conduct thorough testing of the platform for performance and security. Use Replit's testing tools to identify and fix any issues."
"Deploy the initial version of the platform using Replit's hosting services. Gather user feedback to identify areas for improvement."
Additional Considerations:
"Ensure that the platform is accessible and user-friendly. Implement accessibility features to make the platform usable for individuals with disabilities."
"Optimize the platform for performance, ensuring fast load times and smooth user interactions."
Deliverables:

A fully functional platform built from scratch in Replit, matching the provided design description.
An anonymous user system with local storage for preferences.
A technology stack with all necessary dependencies installed and version control set up.
Basic features including search, dynamic feed, explore page, and content curation tools.
A tested and deployed initial version of the platform.
